### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working as an independent contractor at EY Canada.
- 🌱 I’m ~~learning many things~~ narrowing down my learning to DevOps culture and tools. Right now, I'm picking up the basics of Golang.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm selling my house and moving to a condo half the size with my family of three (plus two cats).

**Arvton/Arvton** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a cloud analyst at WithYouWithMe.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things to speed up my transition from being a naval electronics technician to become a tech industry professional. I'm using GitHub Skills to learn more about Git, MS Learn to expand my knowledge on cloud/Azure, and freecodecamp to pick up some developer skills.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play action RPGs like D2R and Grim Dawn to give myself a break from work and studying..  Currently, I'm playing offline and in single player so I don't get sucked in and play too much while I'm trying to self teach being a developer.
