### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a cloud analyst at WithYouWithMe.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things to become a more skilled tech industry professional. I'm keeping my cloud admin knowledge by building out my own cloud projects and picking up web developer knowledge from various places.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a cloud analyst at WithYouWithMe.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things to speed up my transition from being a naval electronics technician to become a tech industry professional. I'm using GitHub Skills to learn more about Git, MS Learn to expand my knowledge on cloud/Azure, and freecodecamp to pick up some developer skills.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play action RPGs like D2R and Grim Dawn to give myself a break from work and studying..  Currently, I'm playing offline and in single player so I don't get sucked in and play too much while I'm trying to self teach being a developer.
