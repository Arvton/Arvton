### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as an independent contractor at EY Canada.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning many things to become a more skilled tech industry professional. In the summer of 2024, I'm growing my cloud knowledge by building cloud projects, learning TypeScript, and testing with Playwright.

**Arvton/Arvton** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a cloud analyst at WithYouWithMe.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things to speed up my transition from being a naval electronics technician to become a tech industry professional. I'm using GitHub Skills to learn more about Git, MS Learn to expand my knowledge on cloud/Azure, and freecodecamp to pick up some developer skills.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play action RPGs like D2R and Grim Dawn to give myself a break from work and studying..  Currently, I'm playing offline and in single player so I don't get sucked in and play too much while I'm trying to self teach being a developer.
